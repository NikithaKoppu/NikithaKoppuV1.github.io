          I primarily focus on backend engineering, but I do love to work collaboratively on all kinds of challenges.
          Throughout my experiences both in my classes and at my internships, I have learned something new whether it be about my personal strengths or about the industry.
          That has kept me excited every day to keep learning and growing.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Edgewise Networks</div>
            <p>In this internship, I spent my time fully integrated with the rest of the development team. I worked on over 66 stories and bugs and contributed to over 15,000 lines of code. While I was doing this, I was able to
            experiment with many different technologies like kafka stream apps, Java Spring Framework, Elasticsearch, docker containers, postgres databases, aws secrets, jenkins deployments etc.
            It was a great learning experience as the dev team was tight knit and collaborative effort was highly encouraged. </p>

            <div class="subheading mb-2">Project: Elasticsearch Events</div>
            <p>One project in particular I was very excited to complete was the integration of elasticsearch for our audit events instead of using postgres. This project became more expansive as I dug into the effort because I also
              needed to get the infrastructure set up to handle the transition and the testing effort of the move. I worked closely with the devops team to address my concerns and what the proper solution should be for confidentiality
              and proper storage. This part of the process involved AWS, cloud elasticsearch clusters, and jenkins along with many iterations to verify the set up. The rest of the development effort was mine to work through which
              involved upgrading out es clients and clusters, juggling credentials, creating the right mappings, and getting kibana users set up. From start to finish, this was a fulfilling experience filled with challenges that I enjoyed
              tackling day to day.

            <h3 class="mb-0">Software Engineer in Test Co-op</h3>
            <div class="subheading mb-3">Edgewise Networks</div>
            <p>In this period, I learned a lot about what the industry was like and specifically what startup environments are like, a fast-paced, community dynamic. I came to enjoy this as I got to be a integral part of the product life
            cycle, I knew what other engineers were working on, and what the customers would say specifically about feature improvements that I had a part in. I was one of two SEITs in the company and I had just as much responsibility as
            my mentor. We would split regression testing, automation efforts, monitor smoke, create test plans, etc for every release and feature that went out the door.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-2">Project: Audit Automation</div>
            <p>The first project that I was given to work on my own team independently was verifying a new feature of audit events that tracked enforcement decisions based on user policies. I was the sole SEIT on the team with two developers
              looking for my input and feedback on the schema, appearance, and verification. I created a framework for the automation tests for both windows and linux agents all the while working closely with the devs to verify their day to day
              feature improvements. Once the framework was in place, the test plan came to life in the automation and my pace for feedback rapidly increased. The tests were put into smoke to verify consistency and the feature was released.
              It was very satisfying to know that my team was able to created this and we worked so well together in the process.

        <p>Using react, developed a project management application to enable students to visualize and organize project milestones over the semester. Through this project I learned a lot about the UX design process
        including personas, storyboarding, iterations of prototypes, usability reports, etc. As engineers we sometimes expect the solution to a problem to be the one we have in mind. That's not usually the case
        as users are unpredictable and they're always right. It's good to anticipate user error but also to take their feedback into consideration when designing a product. </p>

        <p>Using Angular, Java, and MySQL, created a preliminary web application to connect students with tutors by location,
          allowing students to spend more time learning from their tutors than looking for them. Through this I gained experience in full-stack web development</p>

        <p>Apart from being a student, I also am on the organizing core team for a Boston-based hackathon called HackBeanpot. We're a student-led, non-profit, independent organization and this is our 8th annual hackathon.
        I am on the sponsorship team, and we have raised over $18,000 in funds to put on this event for students who are new to hackathons. I've worked closely with my fellow members to craft a sponsorship packet that encompasses
        both the desires of our participants and companies interested. To be able to communicate our core values and hopes for the event to sponsors has been a rewarding experience. My hope is to break down barriers between students
          and company reps to allow better communication and long term interaction. It's been amazing to see how this event comes together over the past year and I'm excited to see it in person in February!</p>

        <p>A new endeavor of mine is mentoring young girls entering the computer science field.
          All throughout highschool, I had an interest in computer science, but without a guiding mentorship program, I ended up dabbling in other areas of study until college.
          When I came to Northeastern, I dove headfirst into the CS program and found like-minded female students who encouraged and pushed me to explore what coding can do.
          Now I am a mentor myself and hope to motivate young girls to not be afraid to dive in because there will always be a community to support them.</p>
